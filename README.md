# 1. This code draws the blades of grass:
# function draw() {
  # stroke(random(60, 70), 100, 90);
  # line(x, height-10, x + random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
# 2. This code makes the lawnmower go by:
# if (random() > 0.999) 
# 3. The "h" variable in the code affects the growth speed of the grass.
# 4. The three variables of colormode affects the color of the grass. Changing HSB to RGB makes the grass more of a neon green color.
# 5. The "-10" in the second and fourth arguments of the line function makes the direction of the grass more random. Removing it from the second and fourth arguments makes the grass smoother and more likely to grow straight upwards.
  
# VIDEO ANSWERS:
# 1. The point of objects is to organize your variables into sections, and make it easier to modify your code.
# 2. A map function could be used for a black to white range, or a range that changes one color to another. For example, a map function can be used in a program that tracks mouseX, and changes the color based on where mouseX is.
# 3. var x = random(1918, 2018)
